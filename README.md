# PROJECT TITLE : 
MYSQL CODING CHALLENGE

## DESCRIPTION :
This project demonstrates various **MySQL concepts** through a set of practice-based coding challenges.  
It includes tasks such as table creation, applying constraints, joins, subqueries, functions, procedures, triggers, and transactions.  
Each topic is designed to strengthen practical SQL knowledge and real-time problem-solving skills.


## GETTING STARTED :

### DEPENDENCIES :
- MySQL Workbench or MySQL CLI  
- Windows 10 or above  
- Basic SQL knowledge
